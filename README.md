# Data Curiosities

Welcome to **Data Curiosities**, a repository dedicated to exploring interesting datasets, uncovering insights, and presenting analyses across a variety of topics.

## About the Project

This project aims to:  
- Curate unique datasets and make them available for analysis.  
- Analyse diverse datasets and provide insightful reports.  
- Explore patterns, trends, and connections in data.  
- Share findings in an interactive and accessible format.  

Whether itâ€™s data from niche communities, global trends, or personal curiosities, this repository is a hub for turning data into stories.

## Features

- **Curated Datasets**: Discover unique and custom-collected data.  
- **Interactive Visualisations**: Engage with dynamic charts and graphs.  
- **Modular Structure**: Each topic is a self-contained section.  
- **Clean Design**: A focus on usability and clarity.  

## Getting Started

At present, this project cannot be run locally as it relies on data loaders connected to a private data warehouse.  
However, I am exploring ways to make curated datasets available publicly in the future.  

Stay tuned for updates!
